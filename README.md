# 🌀 The Ego Hygiene © Manifesto  
### **A Declaration of Self, Healing, & Infinite Consciousness**  

🚀 **Ego Hygiene** is the practice of maintaining clarity in self-awareness, personal growth, and reality perception.  
It is not self-improvement—it is **self-maintenance.** It is not about becoming someone else—it is about **shedding layers to return to your true self.**  

This repository houses the **official Ego Hygiene Manifesto**, along with supporting articles exploring interconnected topics such as **systems thinking, sacred geometry, paradox, and holistic healing.**

## 📜 **The Manifesto**  
The core philosophy of Ego Hygiene is structured in the **[`MANIFESTO.md`](./MANIFESTO.md)** file. It outlines:  
✅ **Healing as a universal process**  
✅ **The ego as a fractal & the need for its maintenance**  
✅ **Reality as a paradox, and self-awareness as alignment**  
✅ **The infinite loop of healing & personal growth**
