# Visual System — Standards

Visuals clarify structure.

They are not decoration.
They are not aesthetic padding.
They must reduce cognitive load.

## When to Include a Visual

Include only if:

- A structural relationship benefits from spatial representation
- A loop or oscillation needs clarification
- A comparison is central to the argument
- A layered abstraction benefits from visual compression

Maximum:
- 1 header
- 2–3 supporting figures

More than 4 visuals requires justification.

---

## Visual Philosophy

Visuals must:

- Be minimal
- Use consistent palette
- Avoid visual noise
- Avoid decorative gradients unless meaningful
- Match article tone (calm, analytical)

No stock photography.
No emoji graphics.
No ornamental fluff.

---

## Naming Convention

Use canonical filenames:

    header.png
    figure1.png
    figure2.png
    figure3.png

All stored in:

    articles/YYYY-MM-slug/assets/

No creative filenames.
No embedded base64 images.

---

## Alt Text Rule

Every image must include:

- Descriptive alt text (what it shows)
- Caption (why it matters)

Alt text = description.
Caption = interpretation.

---

## Design Discipline

A good visual:

- Clarifies a concept instantly
- Does not require reading to decode
- Does not introduce new conceptual branches
- Reinforces a structural pillar

If a visual feels decorative, remove it.
