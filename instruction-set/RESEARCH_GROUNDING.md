# Research Grounding — Standards

Articles make claims. Claims require grounding.

Grounding is not decoration. It is structural reinforcement.

---

## Minimum Requirements

Each article must:

- Reference 3–6 credible sources
- Include at least one Tier 1 or Tier 2 source
- Avoid unsupported statistical claims
- Avoid vague phrases like “studies show”

Sources must directly support structural pillars.

---

## Source Hierarchy

| Tier | Type |
|------|------|
| 1 | Peer-reviewed research |
| 2 | Foundational frameworks or seminal texts |
| 3 | Recognized domain experts |
| 4 | Credible long-form journalism |
| 5 | Primary documentation |

Prefer higher tiers when available.

---

## Integration Rules

- Cite only when the claim requires support.
- Do not over-cite.
- Avoid performative erudition.
- Name theories explicitly.
- Distinguish correlation from causation.
- Avoid recency bias.

Research must strengthen the thesis, not distract from it.

---

## Citation Style

Consistency over perfection.

Each citation must include:

- Author
- Year
- Title
- Venue or DOI

DOIs are preferred when available.

---

## Epistemic Discipline

- Avoid overstating conclusions.
- Do not generalize beyond study scope.
- Note domain boundaries where relevant.
- Avoid importing findings from unrelated contexts without explanation.

Grounding signals intellectual responsibility.
